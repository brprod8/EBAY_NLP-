`Natural Language Processing` (NLP), **Named Entity Recognition** (NER) is a fundamental task to identify the key elements in a text. Extracting the main entities in a text helps sort unstructured data and detect important information, which is crucial if you have to deal with large datasets


## EBAY COMPETITION 2022
*Named entity recognition (NER)*

`Ebay Data Set`
Approximately **20 million** randomly selected unlabeled item titles from eBay

Among these item titles there will be approximately 10,000 labeled item titles (“labeled” means the aspects have been extracted)

 > Train_Tag_Title (‘ttt’) - 30K lines 
 
 > Listing_Title (‘lt’) - 20M Lines
